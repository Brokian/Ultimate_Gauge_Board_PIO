A base setup for PlatformIO for the Ultimate Gauge Board by Garage Tinkering

This will show a gauge designed from a Need for Speed Underground 2 gauge, perform a needle sweep on load, and then set to a value pulled in from CAN (which you likely won't have, so will set to 0).
Over the next couple of days I'll update this with ESPNow config etc too that you can use, but I wanted to get it online as boards are arriving for some people today!
